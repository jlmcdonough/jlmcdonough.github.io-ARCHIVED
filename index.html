	<h2> About Me </h2>
	<p>My name is Joseph McDonough and I am currently a junior at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York. I am currently pursuing a bachelor of science in 
		computer science/software development as well as a major in cybersecurity and minors in information systems and information technology. Growing up, 
		I had a large fascination with baseball and numbers. I had read Moneyball by Michael Lewis when I was around 10 years old and was convinced that I 
		would work for someone in a Billy Beane position. Despite my still large interest in math and numbers and the temptation of data science and analytics 
		today, computers and both software development and later cybersecurity took over. My enjoyment in computers came from when I discovered 
		Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in 2013. There I made scripts (more like text files to execute single line console commands) to make my quality of 
		life better in-game and decided that I kind of liked to do that sort of stuff and would like to explore this side of computers. For high school, I attended 
		Seton Hall Preparatory School in West Orange, New Jersey, and there I had the ability to take two computer science courses (AP Java and AP Computer Science 
		Principles). These courses solidified my interest in working with computers, both programming and hardware as I have also built four computers since then. 
		In the summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to work at BD for a 12-week internship where I worked on the Product Security Engineering Team in which I got 
		to experience several different aspects of both software development and security practices. This experience further solidified my enjoyment in software 
		development and cybersecurity. Overall, with my strong preference for working with statistics and numbers in general, I find myself enjoying the database 
		and back-end work more, but am ultimately up for whatever challenge and excited to learn something new. Outside of work, I spend most of my time either 
		training, watching or playing soccer, playing computer games or the guitar, cooking, and following financial markets.

	<h2> Projects </h2>
		<h4> POLOLU ROBOT</h4>
			<img src="/images/robot.png"  align="center" style="width:75px;height:75px;border-radius=50%;"/><br>
			<p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Robotics>view</a> </p>
				<p> My spring 2021 robotic's course involved various labs that were conducted throughout the entire semester.  All the labs served as stepping
					stones towards the final project, which was to have the robot navigate an obstacle course.  The initial labs were designed to teach the student 
					how the robot works by having the robot move a certain distance forwards and backwards.  As the semester moved along, a ultrasonic sensor 
					and servo were added to the robot to give it more functionality.  Future labs included getting the robot to follow a wall as well as avoiding obstacles 
					with the help of a PID controller.  These new features, combined with the default robot, allowed us to have the robot start on a specific point, and end 
					on another specific point in space, all while avoiding the obstacles.  The robot used in for this course was a <a href=https://www.pololu.com/product/3737>Pololu 3pi+ 32U4 Standard Edition</a>.</p>

		<h4> DISCORD BOT</h4>
			<img src="/images/discord.png"  align="center" style="width:75px;height:75px;border-radius=50%;"/><br>
			<p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/discord-bot>view</a> </p>
				<p> Due to the coronavirus and not being able to work at the beginning of the summer, I decided to spend some of my time to further 
					my use of python and figured creating a discord bot would be a fun and different way to go about this.  The part that was the most 
					enjoyable and look to continue working on in the future is the mini casino games.  Currently, there is a dice game, blackjack, roulette, 
					and a coin flip.  Using the knowledge from a previous database course, I was able to store all the information from the games played as well as 
					the players.  Players have a currency and can bet against players or the bot in the various games.  For the sake of bragging rights, a leaderboard 
					is also avaiable to be seen.  Using the bot and databases, I also added a way to import matches from various video games so that I could keep the 
					data and when a significant of data is collected, I plan on doing another project with it.  This bot is a perpetual project such that when a 
					decent idea for it comes along, will work towards implementing it.   </p>

		<h4> INFECTION SIMULATION</h4>
		<img src="/images/mask.png"  align="center" style="width:75px;height:75px;border-radius=50%;"/><br>
  		<p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Class-Final-Projects/tree/master/Infection%20Simulation>view</a> </p>
			<p> The semester long project for the fall 2020 course of Algorithm Analysis and Design was to create a program to simulate the various testing protocols
				that would be employed for a widespread panademic.  As this course was taken in the midst of Coivd-19, the purpose of this project was to compare 
				different protocols.  On campus, the testing protocol was to take twelve individual tests, pool them together, and then test the pool.  If the pool 
				returned a positive result, then all twelve individuals would be individually tested.  To the class, the professor proposed the idea of groups of 
				eight and if a positive test was found, divide the group into two smaller groups of four to identify which half (or both) contained a positive result.  
				Whichever (or both) group(s) tested positive would result in those four (or eight) individuals being individualally tested.  In my simulation, I allowed 
				for custom user input so the user could modify variables such as infection and group size and even taking into account test inaccuracy (among others).  Some 
				of the findings in the simulation could be found in a report that was submitted along with the code which explained the whole process, each code segmented, and 
				some test cases. </p>

		<h4> IOTA</h4>
		<img src="/images/lang.png"  align="center" style="width:75px;height:75px;border-radius=50%;"/><br>
  		<p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Class-Final-Projects/tree/master/iota>view</a> </p>
			<p> To enforce the concepts learned throughout the fall 2020 course of Theory of Programming Language, the class was divided into groups of four students 
				to create their own programming language that would be built upon the Racket Programming Language, which is built upon Scheme.  Throughout this project, I had to both create 
				the documentation which contained the language overview, formal syntax, and operational semantics and grammars.  Using this rules that were defined 
				in the documentation, I then had to translate this to usable code.  The goal we were trying to acheive in this project was to remove some of the features we did 
				not like in when coding work for this class, as well as adding features that would have been useful.  One of the more annoying issues with Racket is the use of 
				parenthesis and how easy it could be to get lost.  Another would be the way if statements would work and the lack of other control functions (i.e. looping).  
				Iota attempted to fix some of that.  Print lines and useful mathematical and comparison operators would also added.  The end product were some test cases demonstrating 
				all the functionality that we had implemented and a presentation explaining the documentation, code, and test cases to the class. </p>

		<h4> FOX N FOUND</h4>
		<img src="/images/foxnfound.png"  align="center" style="width:75px;height:75px;border-radius=50%;"/><br>
  		<p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Class-Final-Projects/tree/master/FoxNFound>view</a> </p>
			<p> Over the course of the Software Development II class, we were tasked with creating a lost and found database with a website to access it.
				The website was coded in php and the database in MySQL.  With the help of an Abyss Web Server, the website can be run on a localhost and the database
				modified from it.  Essentially, the website allows users to add lost item data and the admins have the ability to add and modify data in all tables.
				Users can report lost items as the founder of the item, or the person who lost it.  Admins can then go in and match a lost item to a found item, indicating that it has
				been returned to its rightful order.  In the event a new building is added, or a new admin user needs to be given proper permissions, the admins can do add to the proper tables from the website.</p>
	
		<br>
		<h4> STUDENT PLANNER</h4>
		<img src="/images/sp.jpg"  align="center" style="width:75px;height:75px;border-radius=50%;"/><br>
		<p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/System-Design>view</a> </p>
			<p> The first project of the spring 2020 Systems Design course tasked teams to build an application prototype.  My group decided on making a planner application that would
				allow students to become more organized.  One of the goals would allow professors to upload a syllabus directly to the app, such that 
				all the assignments that are required from the students would be put into the calendar for them.  The app would give students various calendar and task 
				views as well as filtering assignment by type, professor, or date.  The screens were designed and made using inVision and the prototype can be viewed <a href=https://invis.io/SCW9LP72NPX>here</a>  </p>

		<br>
		<h4> DATABASE DESGIN</h4>
		<img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/149/149749.svg"  align="center" style="width:75px;height:75px;border-radius=50%;"/><br>
  		<p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Class-Final-Projects/tree/master/Database%20Design>view</a> </p>
			<p> For the fall 2019 semester, my database class' semester project was to create a database, using Oracle's SQL Developer, and then create data for it.  With the data, there were ten different
				types of queries that needed to be filled out.  The data I used came from PC game, Counter-Strike:Global Offensive.  Almost all the data is real values from within the game and its professional scene.
				The end product was a report containing the model description, ER-Diagram, table and key definitions,
				justifictaion of third normal form, and the queries. </p>

		<br>
		<h4> LAST STAND</h4>
		<img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/45/45985.svg"  align="center" style="width:75px;height:75px;border-radius=50%;"/><br>
  		<p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Class-Final-Projects/tree/master/LastStand>view</a> </p>
			<p> For the fall 2018 semester, I was tasked with creating a text based adventure game, in the spirit of Zork.  This game was to be built in Python and was a project that took the duration of the semester.
			My game is not too in-depth and is titled "Last Stand".  It takes place in London in the middle of an epidemic. The player chooses a role out of a role list that will determine the strengths and weaknesses of the character.
			The ultimate goal is to gather the necessary supplies, avoid the gangs, and outlive the epidemic and hopefully return home.
			In the near future, I hope to return back to and make it much more random and add new events and customizability. </p>

		<br>
	        <h4> HALLWAY SIMULATOR</h4>
		<img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/59/59809.svg" align="center" style="width:75px;height:75px;border-radius=50%;"/><br>
		<p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Class-Final-Projects/tree/master/HallwaySimulator>view</a></p>
			<p> Spring 2019 semester is the same sort of project as fall 2018, a text based adventure game except this one is in Java.  The theme and requirements are provided by the professor and is more of a follow directions opposed to the complete
			creativity given in my previous work.  The game has a simple GUI whilst prompting starting.  Unlike the python alternative, this game also allows the user to "retrace" their moves as they can view the path they have taken upon completion.
			There is also a scoreboard present so the user can work to constantly imporve their high score.</p>

		<br>
		<h4> KATTIS</h4>
		<img src="/images/kattis.jpg"  align="center" style="width:75px;height:75px;border-radius=50%;"/><br>
      		<p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Kattis-Problems>view</a></p>
			<p> In my first computer class at Marist, my professor introduced us to website called <a href=https://open.kattis.com/users/jmcdonough>kattis</a> which is a website filled with programming problems.
			I dedicated about an hour each day over the semester break to work on these problems and I plan to continue working towards completing most of them.</p>

		<br>
             	<h4> SPROUT CREEK FARMS</h4>
		<a href="https://sproutcreekfarm.org/"><img src="/images/scf.png" align="center" style="width:75px;height:75px;border-radius=50%;"/></a><br>
    		<p><a <a href=/pdf/bus100.pdf>view</a></p>
			<p> Also in the fall 2018 semester, I was part of a team in my business course that was required to bring forth a new idea and produce a business plan for Sprout Creek Farms in Poughkeepsie, New York.
			I served as the Operational Manager of the team along with the research and constructing of the business plan, I was responsible for the day-to-day tasks as well as making sure all the criteria was met and we stayed on track.
			In the end, we found a way for the farm to license their cheeses with local wineries and brought forth an idea for a new organic chocolate line utilizing the left over milk. </p>

				secure.  Essentially, they make sure the devices are secure and are in constant update of new patches
				and exposed vulnerabilites.  I was given a few different tasks to work on.  The main project I worked on
				was bringing KeePass to BD associates.  Although this task does not really fall under the scope of
				Product Security, this project was done to unify Product Security and the internal security team.
				I was part of this small team and created the user guide and documentation for KeePass, as well as
				providing a demo to a pilot group of 300 members, the Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Security Officer.
				I also created a user guide for CylancePROTECT, an AI based security solution.  In this guide, I

				scripts would make sure the KIOSK or IIS would meet BD's secure requirements.  The verification scripts
				would ensure that all requirements were met and the rollback would revert the hardening changes.
				Along with the scripts, I had to create a user guide explaining what the need for KIOSK and IIS hardening
				and how to implement the scripts.  The KIOSK project was sent to various business units and I will be
				invited to a call in the near future where it will be presented to the various executives. </p></td>

				<h4>Marist Ambassadors</h4>
				<p style = "margin-left:40px; margin-right:40px;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:20px;font-size:80%;">My role in the Marist Ambassadors program is as a room tour guide.  Essentially, when prospective parents and students come to recieve a tour of the school, they are also given the ability to see an actual freshman dorm.
					My room is one of those that a tour could come across.  When a tour enters, I greet them and I have a little speech I give about the dorm and room itself as well as  the transition to dorm life and freshman life as a whole.
					I took this job because I am not really comfortable speaking to large groups of people and this is a step in getting me towards comfortability.  I have to be willing to interact with these people along with being knowledgable enough
					about the school so that I can guarantee a correct answer to any questions they throw at me. </p>

				<h4>Camp New Day (August 2017) </h4>
				<p style = "margin-left:40px; margin-right:40px;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:20px;font-size:80%;">Camp New Day is a week long summer camp for developmentally delayed adults.  I attended as a camp counselor and my job is to live with and aid the campers through day-to-day activites.  The camp and fellow counselors set up daiy activites and
					helped this individuals participate in them.  As a counselor, we also helped the campers in getting ready for meals and sleep.  I attended Camp New Day as part of my senior service project for high school.  It seemed like a good way for me to positively impact
					the lives of those who may be struggling.  This was an amazing experience as I learned how to work with and care for developmentally delayed adults because they can act a little different and sporaidc at times. This trip was a week long venture into the unknown and I am super glad that I particpated in it. </p>

				<h4>Elizabeth PBA Local #4 and Children's Specialized Hospital </h4>
				<p style = "margin-left:30px; margin-right:30px;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:20px;font-size:80%;background-color:white;"> Every December, about two weeks before Christmas, the Elizabeth PBA hosts an event with the Children's Specialized Hospital.  The event, Shop With a Cop, allows for children of the Children's Specialized Hospital in Mountainside, New Jersey to go Christmas shopping for family and friends.
					Ordinarly, these kids are not given much independence and are not able to go and pick out there own gifts for family.  This event allows them to do that.  I volunteer in all possible aspects.  There is a charity run before the shopping event in which I arrive early to help set up the course as well as give water to runners.  For the shopping event, I help set up and clean up, as well as
					going shopping with some of the kids and serve them lunch.  In the end, it is a long 12 hour day that I look forward to each year. <a style="background-color:white" href="/images/swc.jpg">Letter from Governor of New Jersey</a>.</p>
