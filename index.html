	<h2> About Me </h2>
	<p>Hey there! My name is Joseph McDonough and I am currently a freshman at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York.  I am currently pursuing a bachelor of science in computer science/software development as well as a major in cybersecurity and minors in information systems and information technology.    
	My enjoyment in computers came from when I discovered Counter-Strike:Global Offensive in 2013.  There I made scripts to make my quality of life better in game and decided that I kind of liked to do that sort of stuff.    
	I attended Seton Hall Preparatory School in West Orange, New Jersey and there I had the ability to take two computer science courses (AP Java and AP Computer Science Principles). It was in those courses that I decided this is what I want to do.  
	When not on my computer, chances are I am with my dog, Talia.  Also a big supporter of Tottenham Hotspur FC.</p>

	<h2> Projects </h2>
	<p> For the fall 2018 semester, I was tasked with creating a text based adventure game, in the spirit of Zork.  This game was to be built in Python and was a project that took the duration of the semester.  
		My game is not too in-depth and is titled "Last Stand".  It takes place in London in the middle of an epidemic. The player chooses a role out of a role list that will determine the strengths and weaknesses of the character. The ultimate goal is to gather the necessary supplies, avoid the gangs, and outlive the epidemic and hopefully return home.  
		In the near future, I hope to return back to and make it much more random and add new events and customizability.  
		The zip containing the game and the necessary files can be downloaded <a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Class-Final-Projects/blob/master/lastStand.zip> here</a>.</p>
	<br>
	<p> Also in the fall 2018 semester, I was part of a team in my business course that was required to bring forth a new idea and produce a business plan for Sprout Creek Farms in Poughkeepsie, New York.  
		I served as the Operational Manager of the team as along with the research and constructing of the business plan, I was responsible for the day-to-day tasks as well as making sure all the criteria was met and we stayed on track.  
		In the end, we found a way for the farm to license their cheeses with local wineries and brought forth an idea for a new organic chocolate line utilizing the left over milk.  The business plan that we pitched to the class can be found <a href=/pdf/bus100.pdf> here</a>.</p>
	<br>
	<p> Spring 2019 semester is the same sort of project, a text based adventure game except this one is in Java.  The theme and requirements are provided by the professor and is more of a follow directions opposed to the complete 
		creativity given in my previous work.  As the semester is not yet over, the game is not finished.  Progress can be tracked <a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Software-Development-I> here</a>.</p>
	<br>
	<p> In my first computer class at Marist, my professor introduced us to website called <a href=https://open.kattis.com/users/jmcdonough>kattis</a> which is a website filled with programming problems.  
		I dedicated about an hour each day over the semester break to work on these problems and I plan to continue.  My solutions can be found <a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Kattis-Problems> here</a>.</p>

	<h2> Work </h2>
	<!-- <h4> Marist Ambassadors </h4>
	<p> My role in the Marist Ambassadors program is as a room tour guide.  Essentially, when prospective parents and students come to recieve a tour of the school, they are also given the ability to see an actual freshman dorm.  
		My room is one of those that a tour could come across.  When a tour enters, I greet them and I have a little speech I give about the dorm and room itself as well as  the transition to dorm life and freshman life as a whole.  
		I took this job because I am not really comfortable speaking to large groups of people and this is a step in getting me towards comfortability.  I have to be willing to interact with these people along with being knowledgable enough 
		about the school so that I can guarantee a correct answer to any questions they throw at me. </p>
	<br>
	<h4> Camp New Day (August 2017) </h4>
	<p> Camp New Day is a week long summer camp for developmentally delayed adults.  I attended as a camp counselor and my job is to live with and aid the campers through day-to-day activites.  The camp and fellow counselors set up daiy activites and 
	helped this individuals participate in them.  As a counselor, we also helped the campers in getting ready for meals and sleep.  I attended Camp New Day as part of my senior service project for high school.  It seemed like a good way for me to positively impact 
	the lives of those who may be struggling.  This was an amazing experience as I learned how to work with and care for developmentally delayed adults because they can act a little different and sporaidc at times.  Camp New Day also was the first time I was away from home 
	for an extended period of time and I only went with a few friends.  I was venturing into the unknown and took this oppurnity as a way to challenge myself into becoming more comfortable in new surroundings and interacting with essentially strangers.</p>
	<br>
	<h4> Elizabeth PBA Local #4 and Children's Specialized Hospital </h4>
	<p> Every December, about two weeks before Christmas, the Elizabeth PBA hosts an event with the Children's Specialized Hospital.  The event, Shop With a Cop, allows for children of the Children's Specialized Hospital in Mountainside, New Jersey to go Christmas shopping for family and friends.  
	Ordinarly, these kids are not given much independence and are not able to go and pick out there own gifts for family.  This event allows them to do that.  I have volunteered whenever I could and I go along with a police office and take these kids shopping.  I also help setting and cleaning up the event 
	as well as serving the children lunch.  Prior to the shop with a cop, there is a charity 5k that takes place in the morning which also benefits the Children Hospital.  I would arrive in time to help set up the cones for the race as well as supplying finishers with water.  In the end, it is usually a long twelve-hour day 
	but very much worth it and enjoyable as I look forward to it each year. </p> -->
