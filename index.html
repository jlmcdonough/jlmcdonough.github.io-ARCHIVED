	<h2> About Me </h2>
	<p>Hey there! My name is Joseph McDonough and I am currently a sophomore at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York.  I am currently pursuing a bachelor of science in computer science/software development as well as a major in cybersecurity and minors in information systems and information technology.    
	My enjoyment in computers came from when I discovered Counter-Strike:Global Offensive in 2013.  There I made scripts to make my quality of life better in game and decided that I kind of liked to do that sort of stuff.    
	I attended Seton Hall Preparatory School in West Orange, New Jersey and there I had the ability to take two computer science courses (AP Java and AP Computer Science Principles).  
	These courses solidified my interest in working with computers, both programming and the hardware as I have also built two computers.  In the summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to work at BD for a 12 week internship where 
	I worked on the Product Security Engineering Team in which I got to experience several different aspects of both software development and security practices. </p>

	<br>
		<h4> LAST STAND</h4>
		<img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/45/45985.svg"  align="center" style="width:75px;height:75px;border-radius=50%;"/><br>
  		<p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Class-Final-Projects/tree/master/LastStand>view</a> </p>
			<p> For the fall 2018 semester, I was tasked with creating a text based adventure game, in the spirit of Zork.  This game was to be built in Python and was a project that took the duration of the semester.  
			My game is not too in-depth and is titled "Last Stand".  It takes place in London in the middle of an epidemic. The player chooses a role out of a role list that will determine the strengths and weaknesses of the character. The ultimate goal is to gather the necessary supplies, avoid the gangs, and outlive the epidemic and hopefully return home.  
			In the near future, I hope to return back to and make it much more random and add new events and customizability. </p> 
		<br>
	
             	<h4> SPROUT CREEK FARMS</h4>
		<a href="https://sproutcreekfarm.org/"><img src="/images/scf.jpg" align="center" style="width:75px;height:75px;border-radius=50%;"/></a><br>
    		<p><a <a href=/pdf/bus100.pdf>view</a></p>     
			<p> Also in the fall 2018 semester, I was part of a team in my business course that was required to bring forth a new idea and produce a business plan for Sprout Creek Farms in Poughkeepsie, New York.  
			I served as the Operational Manager of the team along with the research and constructing of the business plan, I was responsible for the day-to-day tasks as well as making sure all the criteria was met and we stayed on track.  
			In the end, we found a way for the farm to license their cheeses with local wineries and brought forth an idea for a new organic chocolate line utilizing the left over milk. </p>
		<br>
		
	        <h4> HALLWAY SIMULATOR</h4>
		<img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/59/59809.svg" align="center" style="width:75px;height:75px;border-radius=50%;"/><br>
		<p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Class-Final-Projects/tree/master/HallwaySimulator>view</a></p>
			<p> Spring 2019 semester is the same sort of project as fall 2018, a text based adventure game except this one is in Java.  The theme and requirements are provided by the professor and is more of a follow directions opposed to the complete 
			creativity given in my previous work.  The game has a simple GUI whilst prompting starting.  Unlike the python alternative, this game also allows the user to "retrace" their moves as they can view the path they have taken upon completion.  
			There is also a scoreboard present so the user can work to constantly imporve their high score.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h4> KATTIS</h4>
		<img src="/images/kattis.jpg"  align="center" style="width:75px;height:75px;border-radius=50%;"/><br>
      		<p><a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Kattis-Problems>view</a></p>
			<p> In my first computer class at Marist, my professor introduced us to website called <a href=https://open.kattis.com/users/jmcdonough>kattis</a> which is a website filled with programming problems.  
			I dedicated about an hour each day over the semester break to work on these problems and I plan to continue working towards completing most of them.

				a Product Security Engineer Intern at BD in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey.  BD is a medical technology 
				company that makes and sells these devices.  The role of the Product Security Engineering Team is to 
				ensure that the patient's personally identifiable information and protected health information remains 
				secure.  Essentially, they make sure the devices are secure and are in constant update of new patches 
				and exposed vulnerabilites.  I was given a few different tasks to work on.  The main project I worked on
				was bringing KeePass to BD associates.  Although this task does not really fall under the scope of 
				Product Security, this project was done to unify Product Security and the internal security team.  
				I was part of this small team and created the user guide and documentation for KeePass, as well as 
				providing a demo to a pilot group of 300 members, the Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Security Officer.
				I also created a user guide for CylancePROTECT, an AI based security solution.  In this guide, I 
				discussed the benefits of Cylance and how to install and implement it with best practices.  This guide 
				is to be sent to users of BD devices.  The two projects I did that were focused around Product Security 
				were the hardening of a KIOSK and Internet Information Services.  For these two projects, I had to teach
				myself PowerShell so that I could create a hardening, verification, and rollback scripts.  The hardening
				scripts would make sure the KIOSK or IIS would meet BD's secure requirements.  The verification scripts
				would ensure that all requirements were met and the rollback would revert the hardening changes.  
				Along with the scripts, I had to create a user guide explaining what the need for KIOSK and IIS hardening
				and how to implement the scripts.  The KIOSK project was sent to various business units and I will be
				invited to a call in the near future where it will be presented to the various executives. </p></td>
