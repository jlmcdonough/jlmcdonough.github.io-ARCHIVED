	<h2> About Me </h2>
	<p> I am Joseph McDonough and I am currently a freshman at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York.  I am currently pursuing a bachelor of science in computer science/software development as well as a major in cybersecurity and minors in information systems and information technology.    
	My enjoyment in computers came from when I discovered Counter-Strike:Global Offensive in 2013.  There I made scripts to make my quality of life better in game and decided that I kind of liked to do that sort of stuff.    
	I attended Seton Hall Prepatory School in West Orange, New Jersey and there I had the ability to take two computer science courses (AP Java and AP Computer Science Principles). It was in those courses that I decided this is what I want to do.  
	When not on my computer, chances are I am with my dog, Talia.  Also a big supporter of Tottenham Hotspur FC.</p>

	<h2> Projects </h2>
	<p> For the fall 2018 semester, I was tasked with creating a text based adventure game, in the spirit of Zork.  This game was to be built in Python and was a project that took the duration of the semester.  
		My game is not too in-depth and is titled "Last Stand".  and takes place in London in the middle of an epidemic. The player chooses a role out of a role list that will determine the strengths and weaknesses of the character. The ultimate goal is to gather the necessary supplies, avoid the gangs, and outlive the epidemic and hopefully return home.  
		In the near future, I hope to return back to and make it much more random and add new events and customizability.  
		The zip containing the game and the necessary files can be downloaded <a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Class-Final-Projects/blob/master/lastStand.zip> here. </a></p>
	<br>
	<p> Spring 2019 semester is the same sort of project, a text based adventure game except this one is in Java.  The theme and requirements are provided by the professor and is more of a follow directions opposed to the complete 
		creativity given in my previous work.  As the semester is not yet over, the game is not finished.  Progress can be tracked <a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Software-Development-I> here. </a></p>
	<br>
	<p> In my first computer class at Marist, my professor introduced us to website called <a href=http://open.kattis.com> kattis </a> which is a website filled with programming problems.  
		I dedicated about an hour each day over the semester break to work on these problems and I plan to continue.  My solutions can be found <a href=https://github.com/jlmcdonough/Kattis-Problems> here. </a></p>
